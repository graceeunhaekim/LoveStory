							<h1>How We Met</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>First time we ever met was July 17, 2021. Danny and Mareike invited me to go check out Wondercade with them. Danny said that he invited his 
							biker friends but only one friend showed. That friend was Alex. The first thing I said to Alex was "Oh you're the boat guy" because that's all I knew about him through Danny. I think at that time, Alex was freshly out of a relationship and I was doing my own thing with my guy best friend, so nothing came out of this meeting. We just played games and that was that! After that day, I met him one other time on his boat before we didn't see each other for an entire year</p>
							<p>Fast forward to almost exactly a year later. It's April 16, 2022, Danny and Mareike's surprise wedding day! This was the day Alex came up to me as I was leaving the wedding and shot his shot. Except I'm not great at flirting and oblivious to all signs. So when he invited me to join on a boat ride, instead of giving him my number I said, "oh for sure, I think we're friends on facebook so message me!" Amazing. So good. -_-; Then we go our separate ways and I don't see him again until 2 months later. June 24, 2022, I get a facebook message from Alex inviting me on a boat ride on the river with Danny and Mareike. At this point, I still think he's just being a nice person/friend so I'm like hell yea let's go hang out on a boat with no pressure or reason to be nervous. I started to realize that he was looking for more than friendship when he sat really close to me on the boat and started asking questions to get to know me better. But I wasn't completely sure until the end of our boat outing when he refused my high five and gave me a hug instead. </p>
							<p>Then a couple days later, on my 28th birthday, we went on our very first date. We went to the aquarium and then got dinner :)</p>
